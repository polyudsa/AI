# TSPSolveByGA

### Introduce
Use GA to solve TSP problems

### Environment
* `Win 10 or Mac`
* `Python 3`

### Package
Enter the project directory and run the following command
```shell
pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```

### GA

#### Usage
Enter the current src folder, and then enter the following command
```
python tsp_solved_by_genetic_algorithm.py
```
#### Result
*Problem1:* `TSP - ch10`
*Problem2:* `TSP - ch20`
*Problem3:* `TSP - ch30`
*Problem4:* `TSP - ch10 and have srat point and end point`
*Problem5:* `TSP - ch20 and have srat point and end point`
*Problem6:* `TSP - ch30 and have srat point and end point`


#### My Solution
